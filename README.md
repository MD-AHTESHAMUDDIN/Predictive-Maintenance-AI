# Predictive-Maintenance-AI
AI-driven predictive maintenance model that reduces equipment failure rates and optimizes repair schedules.

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict equipment failures and enable proactive maintenance. It incorporates SMOTENC for handling imbalanced data, PCA for dimensionality reduction, and Streamlit for interactive deployment.

## Features
- Failure classification for preventive maintenance
- Cost savings through optimized repair schedules
- Deployed using Streamlit for real-time monitoring

## Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit
- PCA, SMOTENC, Machine Learning

## Usage
Clone the repository and run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
